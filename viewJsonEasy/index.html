					The dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension.
					Shaped by the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a
					unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids.

					<strong class="raceFeatTitle">Age</strong>
					<text class="raceFeatDesc"
						>Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and
						development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15.
						They live to be around 80.</text

					<strong class="raceFeatTitle">Alignment</strong>
					<text class="raceFeatDesc"
						>Dragonborn tend towards extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other
						between Good and Evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). More side with
						Bahamut than Tiamat (whose non-dragon followers are mostly kobolds), but villainous
						dragonborn can be quite terrible indeed. Some rare few choose to devote themselves to
						lesser dragon deities, such as Chronepsis (Neutral), and fewer still choose to worship
						Io, the Ninefold Dragon, who is all alignments at once.</text

					<strong class="raceFeatTitle">Draconic Ancestry</strong>
					<text class="raceFeatDesc"
						>You are distantly related to a particular kind of dragon. Choose a type of dragon from
						the below list; this determines the damage and area of your breath weapon, and the type
						of resistance you gain.</text

					<strong class="raceFeatTitle">Breath Weapon</strong>
					<text class="raceFeatDesc"
						>You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. It deals damage in an area
						according to your ancestry. When you use your breath weapon, all creatures in the area
						must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your ancestry. The DC of
						this saving throw is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature
						takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The
						damage increase to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th, and 5d6 at 16th level. After using
						your breath weapon, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
						HBInstead, you may use your breath weapon a number of times equal to your Constitution
						modifier. You regain expended uses on a short or long rest.</text
